"""Onroad GNSS health readout.

Built to measure RF desense from the external GPU's USB-C link: with the eGPU unplugged the
receiver demodulates satellite time from ~93% of tracked satellites and fixes immediately, and
with it plugged in that collapses to 0% while the tracked satellite count actually rises. Raw
satellite counts are therefore misleading on their own - the demodulation rate and C/No are what
show whether a cable, ferrite or antenna placement change helped.
