# Process replay

Process replay is a regression test designed to identify any changes in the output of a process. This test replays a segment through individual processes and compares the output to a known good replay. Each make is represented in the test with a segment.

If the test fails, make sure that you didn't unintentionally change anything. If there are intentional changes, the reference logs will be updated.

Use `test_processes.py` to run the test locally.
Log files are cached by default. Use `DISABLE_FILEREADER_CACHE='1' test_processes.py` to disable caching.

Currently the following processes are tested:

* controlsd
* radard
* plannerd
* calibrationd
* dmonitoringd
* locationd
* paramsd
* ubloxd
* torqued

### Usage
```
Usage: test_processes.py [-h] [--whitelist-procs PROCS] [--whitelist-cars CARS] [--blacklist-procs PROCS]
                         [--blacklist-cars CARS] [--ignore-fields FIELDS] [--ignore-msgs MSGS] [--update-refs]
Regression test to identify changes in a process's output
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --whitelist-procs PROCS               Whitelist given processes from the test (e.g. controlsd)
  --whitelist-cars WHITELIST_CARS       Whitelist given cars from the test (e.g. HONDA)
  --blacklist-procs BLACKLIST_PROCS     Blacklist given processes from the test (e.g. controlsd)
  --blacklist-cars BLACKLIST_CARS       Blacklist given cars from the test (e.g. HONDA)
  --ignore-fields IGNORE_FIELDS         Extra fields or msgs to ignore (e.g. driverMonitoringState.events)
  --ignore-msgs IGNORE_MSGS             Msgs to ignore (e.g. onroadEvents)
  --update-refs                         Updates reference logs using current commit
```

## Forks

openpilot forks can use this test with their own reference logs, by default `test_proccesses.py` saves logs locally.

To generate new logs:

`./test_processes.py`

Then, check in the new logs through the external test-data catalog. Make sure to also update the `ref_commit` file to the current commit.

## API

Process replay test suite exposes programmatic APIs for simultaneously running processes or groups of processes on provided logs.

```py
def replay_process_with_name(name: Union[str, Iterable[str]], lr: LogIterable, *args, **kwargs) -> List[capnp._DynamicStructReader]:

def replay_process(
  cfg: Union[ProcessConfig, Iterable[ProcessConfig]], lr: LogIterable, frs: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
  fingerprint: Optional[str] = None, return_all_logs: bool = False, custom_params: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None, disable_progress: bool = False
) -> List[capnp._DynamicStructReader]:
```

Example usage:
```py
from openpilot.selfdrive.test.process_replay import replay_process_with_name
from openpilot.tools.lib.logreader import LogReader

lr = LogReader(...)

# provide a name of the process to replay
output_logs = replay_process_with_name('locationd', lr)

# or list of names
output_logs = replay_process_with_name(['ubloxd', 'locationd'], lr)
```

Supported processes:
* controlsd
* radard
* plannerd
* calibrationd
* dmonitoringd
* locationd
* paramsd
* ubloxd
* torqued
* modeld
* dmonitoringmodeld

Certain processes require saved initial state in `Params`, such as `CalibrationParams`
or `LiveParametersV2`. Managed schema caches in `custom_params` must contain verified
envelopes created by `openpilot.starpilot.schema_cache.put_cache` from current-schema
messages whose origin is known. Synthetic current-schema fixtures can use this path.

Historical logs require source schema provenance and an explicit schema-specific
conversion before their values can seed these caches. Reading old bytes through the
current schema does not establish compatibility. `get_custom_params_from_lr` now
refuses this operation, and automatic firmware `CarParamsCache` seeding also refuses
unless a verified envelope was supplied. Configuration is checked before Params
writes. An explicit current vehicle fingerprint can avoid firmware-cache seeding,
but does not qualify the remaining logged messages.

The complete historical process-replay suite is not currently qualified: cases
depending on these implicit caches are blocked pending fixture conversion. Do not
regenerate expected outputs to hide that boundary or count these cases as passing.

Replaying processes that use VisionIPC (e.g. modeld, dmonitoringmodeld) require additional `frs` dictionary with camera states as keys and `FrameReader` objects as values.

```py
from openpilot.tools.lib.framereader import FrameReader

frs = {
  'narrowRoadCameraState': FrameReader(...),
  'wideRoadCameraState': FrameReader(...),
  'cabinCameraState': FrameReader(...),
}

output_logs = replay_process_with_name(['modeld', 'dmonitoringmodeld'], lr, frs=frs)
```

To capture stdout/stderr of the replayed process, `captured_output_store` can be provided.

```py
output_store = dict()
# pass dictionary by reference, it will be filled with standard outputs - even if process replay fails
output_logs = replay_process_with_name(['radard', 'plannerd'], lr, captured_output_store=output_store)

# entries with captured output in format { 'out': '...', 'err': '...' } will be added to provided dictionary for each replayed process
print(output_store['radard']['out']) # radard stdout
print(output_store['radard']['err']) # radard stderr
```
